- a Broad class where 3 types fall under it
  - Image Classification - classifying an image 
  - Object localization  - Locationa bounding box aroung a object in an image
  - Object detection     - Combining both classification and Localization and draws a bounding box around multiple images with their class/label
  - Object Segmentation/ Semantic Segmentation - Instead of drawing with Boundary box, we will group same pixels that has similar meaning
